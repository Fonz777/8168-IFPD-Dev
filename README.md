# 8168-IFPD-Dev
Produce a program that automates the design of Instrument Flight Procedures as described in ICAO Doc PANS OPS 8168 Vol 2. The output will allow the manual (initially) entry of data which the program will then use to make the caluclations as descirbed in the document, show the results of calculations and output an AutoCAD file that shows the visual representation of the design. The output should also be overlaid on a Google Earth map or equivalent for demonstration purposes.

Commercial aircraft departing and arriving airports will generally fly a published procedure based on a form of navigation aid such as GPS or a ground based beacon (VOR/NDB/ILS).

ICAO is the worldwide regulating body for all matters to do with aviation. They produce Document PANS-OPS 8168 and Volume 2 deals with the requirements for Instrument Flight Procedure Design and specifically the protection areas that ensure aircraft flight paths clear all obstacles by the required margins..

Manually calculating and drawing protection areas (2D) is time consuming, open to error and does not easily allow the use of a lare number of obstacles. Automating this process and producing a standard output eliminates this and allows me to concentrate on applying practical/operational changes that make the procedure more efficient.

Design requirements cannot always be met so the program should identify when this is the case.
The regulations, assumed values and calculations occasionally change so it should be easy to adjust these in the program.

The files I include with this project are examples of the manual work I had to do to produce the calculations which I then used to manually draw in AutoCAD the protection areas for the flight procedure in question.

Thankyou very much for your help!
